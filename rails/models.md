#### Enum

Use enum to define a limited set of options for an attribute and helps ensure that only valid values are assigned to it.
```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  enum role: { admin: 0, moderator: 1, user: 2 }
end
```
The keys in the hash represent the named values, and their values represent the integer values that will be stored in the database. You can assign values to the attribute using the named values:
```ruby
user = User.new(role: :admin)
user.role # => "admin"
user.role = :moderator
user.role # => "moderator"
```
You can also use various methods generated by the enum to check which values are available and to retrieve records that have a particular value:
```ruby
User.roles # => { admin: 0, moderator: 1, user: 2 }
User.admins # => returns all users with role == 0 (i.e. "admin")
user.admin? # => true if user.role == "admin"
```
