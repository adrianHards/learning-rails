Select a line or multiple lines of code and then click: <br>
* `option arrow key` to move the code up ↑ or down ↓ a line
* `⌘ /` to comment out your code, no matter which language you are using
* `⇥` to indent the line(s) to the right or `⇧ ⇥` to reverse indent
* `⌃ ~`  to open a new terminal. Alternatively, you can use Replit to play around with small snippets of code.
* click on a word and then `⌘ d` to find and select all matching words in your code, then delete or start typing what you want to replace the word with
fn ⌫ to reverse delete
* `option z` toggle size to content width (for when you have lines that are far too long!)
