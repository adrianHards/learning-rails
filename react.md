There are two ways to use React with RoR. The first is to build two separate, standalone apps, with the React app on a different repository, communicating with the backend via an API. <br><br>
This can be achieved by creating both apps separately using [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) and the Rails CLI. The other way is by having both apps in one repository, running side by side. Here,I'll be doing the former.
